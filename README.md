A "Fang den Hut"-clon for the browser created with p5.js. 
This game is supposed to clone the famous german boardgame "Fang den Hut". 
The difficulty lies in the tiles which are a lot of rounded quadtangles, that are orderd in a circle shaped form. 

First Problem I need to solve is the collision detection. 
-> Idea 1: Detection how many intersections accour between the mouse-(0,0)-line and the contour of the shape.
